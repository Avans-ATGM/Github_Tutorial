# Welcome to Part 2 of the tutorial!! 

Now we start by adding 2 headers in the README file, so it's clear what was in the first and second tutorial.
1. Add 2 ## headers with Part1 and Part2. 

Next, we're adding a new folder with it's own README file, which will include a galaxy workflow (file + picture)<br>
For this you can use your own made galaxy workflow + screenshot or you can use the one from the example

2. First we are going to make the the new folder and README.md file<br>
    - Click on the "Add file" and select "Create new file"
    - After the Github_Tutorial/ add: `Workflows/README.md`
    - (This will add the folder Workflows and the file README at once)
    - In this file:<br>
            - Start with a header<br>
            - Write an explanation what is in the folder<br>
            - Add the file link under the explanation<br>
            - Add the picture underneath and make sure it is shown in the README file<br>
            - Now commit<br>
            - Now add the file to the folder

Then you'll get something like this:<br>

3. Now create a link to the workflow folder in the main README file, using: ./Workflows as link.<br>

Now you'll have to do the same thing, without the picture, to get something like this:<br>

4. Now add the new folder + README + python script (make sure you can make the script public) and add it all to a new branch.<br>
In the README in the python folder, use the python code syntax to add your python code to the README file.<br>
Only when finished with the whole folder, use the pull request to merge them. 

5. Add the link to the python_scripts folder to the main README file. (use: ./python_scripts)

By using ./python_scripts you are softcoding the link. By doing this someone else can also copy your repository, with working links connecting to their copied repository. If you hardcode it your links will connect you to the original repository.

Finally we're going to check the history/commits to our repository. 

6. By clicking the ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42538229/137876400-908ccb4c-6b0f-461e-b939-24702cdccc05.png) or ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42538229/137876517-c841cd6e-4f34-4529-bce8-4a88f8a672fc.png) icon you can see each modification of your repository/folder/file.<br>
This can be very helpful to see what other people contributed to the repository or to seek errors in code or tools. 

Now you should know enough to create your own repository and do the general modification in github.
